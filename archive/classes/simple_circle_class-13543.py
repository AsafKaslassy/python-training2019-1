# Develop a simple module that includes the definition for the Circle class.
# Each object instantiated from that class should represent a specific circle.
# The definition for the Circle class should include two methods: area() and perimeter().
# Develop a separated module that uses the circle module and creates two objects for representing two
# circles. The first circle has the 5cm radius.
# The second circle has the 6cm radius.
# Your code should print out the area and the perimeter of each one of these two circles.
