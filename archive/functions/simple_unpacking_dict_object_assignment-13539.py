# Develop a simple script that includes the definition of the average function.
# The average function has four parameters: math, physics, chemistry, and history.
# The average function should receive the marks in these four subjects and return their average.
# You should include the required code for calculating David's average.
# David's marks (90 in math, 92 in physics, 80 in chemistry and 70 in history)
# should be passed over packed in a dict object.

# The name we are looking for
studentName = 'david'

# All students grades
