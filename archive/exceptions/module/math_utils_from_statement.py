# Define the utils module with the following functions: sumof, multiplyof and differenceof.
# Each one of these three functions is capable of receiving two arguments and return the calculation of their
# sum, multiplication or difference.
# Define a separated module where you will use the utils' functions. Use the 'from' statement in that other module.
