# TODO: files - assignment not finished.
# Create a file that includes ID numbers. Each row includes a specific ID number.
# ID numbers might repeat themselves.
# Write a short program that reads the ID numbers from the file and prints them to the screen.
# Your short program should use the Set collection in order to avoid printing the same ID number more than once.
